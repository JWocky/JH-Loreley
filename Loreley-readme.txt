Loreley readme.

This is not intended to be an accurate representation of an SU-27 or 38 but
the Loreley serves as test platform for new tricks in the development of 
aircraft for FlightGear. The model of a SU-37 was only chosen for its cool
looks. Kind of if you need to accelerate a time machine to 150 mph, you can
build it as good into a DeLorean. 

This FG aircraft should be regarded as experimental. While it is
flyable and fun to fly, it is subject to experimental changes without 
further notice.

The original "experimental" SU-37 on which the Loreley is built was
created by Lee Elliot in 2006.

Th name "Loreley" refers to a fictional experimental high-altitude interceptor 
from  a Clice Cussler novel.

The Loreley is licensed under GPL V2.0 or later.
